----- Style convention

- There's a .xml file in log which can be imported to eclipse
- Braces are always used, even when optional
- Blocks: K&R style
- Block indentation: 4 spaces
- Column limit: 80 characters (everything else is weird)
- There are some limit exceptions like JavaDoc links
- Always use CTRL+SHIFT+F after editing (use PowerRacerFormattingStyle.xml)
- There's no such thing as too many comments

-----  Naming convention

- Package names: every letter is small (packageexample)
- Class names: UpperCamelCase
- Method names: lowerCamelCase
- Constant names: CONSTANTCASE
